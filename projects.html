        In the beginning of 2022 I wanted to get more familiar with blender.
        <br>
        At the time NFT business got popular and I decided to make NFTs.
        <br>
        But I didnt have any idea what to create, So I got inspitration from my girlfriend
        <br>
        She wanted to work at nasa, And so I came up with the idea to make simple astronauts
        <br>
        I posted them on a daily basis on Instagram. <i>(if you would like to buy one just contact me there)</i>
        <br>
        <span class="orange__highlight">I really enjoyed making them and learned a lot from them.</span>

        After the things I learned and the fun I had making Astronauts I decided to make more in blender.
        <br>
        I started with really easy and basic shapes with nice textures. (minimalistic)
        <br>
        And I later proceded to making more complex realistic scenes. (Particles, etc.)
        <br>
        I also posted my whole journey on GitHub, so that you can check them out for yourself.
        <br>
        You might recognise some from YouTube, Because I followed a few tutorials.
        <br>
        I followed the tutorials to hopefully improve faster and with more enjoyment.
        <br>

        In my journey of becomming a developer, I made a few Python programs.
        <br>
        I made projects like a spam bot, a password generator, and more.
        <br>
        Next to that I also followd a few tutorials to try and learn Python.
        <br>
        These included an autoclicker, a few turtle related programs, etc.
        <br>
        I'm reading "Python Crash Course", to get an even better understanding of Python.
        <br>
        <span class="orange__highlight">Python is one of my favorite languages because its simple and gives fun results.</span>

        I started coding my first website after messing around with Python for a while.
        <br>
        I decided to make a portefolio website which is the one you are seeing now.
        <br>
        I really enjoyed making this website because you have to use multiple languages.
        <br>
        After finishing this website I stopped for a while and later I made a company website.
        <br>
        You can visit the website too, and it is just a template.
        <br>
        <span class="orange__highlight">I learned a lot of new things and imporved a lot. Great experience.</span>

        Next to the above mentioned projects I made a lot more projects.
        <br>
        I have worked in unity a lot but didn't get any solid project from it.
        <br>
        I did learn a lot from my experiences with Unity and the C# language.
        <br>
        Next to using unity, I also tried out languages like Rust, Ruby, Java and even some Swift with Dart.
        <br>
        But I didn't learn a lot from these experiences, they were pretty fun tho.
        <br>
        For the rest I experimented with different Linux distros and stuff like microcontrollers.
        <br>
        <span class="orange__highlight">In conclusion I liked Unity and would like to learn C# better, And I enjoyed working with Linux.</span>

      <h1 class="box lightpink__colored" data-aos="zoom-out">
        I made projects in the past but they were more to just experiment.
        <br>
        The projects were like making a simple game etc. and it was more to get into coding.
        <br>
        So a lot of the projects were from tutorials I followed.
        <br>
        Most of these projects I also never finished and had lots of hard to solve bugs.
        <br>
        <span class="orange__highlight">If I could redo somethings it would be to watch less tutorials and read more.</span>
        <br>
        90% of peolpes that follow tutorials don't think twice and just copy everything.
        <br>
        And in the end you learn barely anything from it.
        <br>
        Reading on the other hand is way more effective because you think more about it.
        <br>
        And you don't just blindly follow a tutorial. (Im nost saying that tutorials are bad)

        In the future I would like to understand app development better and the language like C#, Dart, Swift.
        <br>
        I also would like to learn more about game development (so C, C++ and C#) and understand it well.
        <br>
        For Python I bought "Python Crash Course", to hopefully completely understand Python.
        <br>
        I didn't have a lot of difficulty with making a website because I know HTML and CSS pretty well.
        <br>
        But I would like to learn JavaScript for more back-end website programming.
        <br>
        Furthermore I'm really trying to focus on school and to pass school.
        <br>
